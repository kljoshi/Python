Step 1:
- First find the file path of Python installation on your device
	- if you do not know where your Python was installed do the following step:
		- open "cmd"
		- type 'python'
		- Python 2.6.6 (r266:84297, Aug 24 2010, 18:13:38) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
			Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
			>>> import sys
			>>> sys.executable
			'c:\\Python26\\python.exe'

		After you know the location of your python installation follow step 2.

Step 2:
- open "cmd"
- cd into file path to python but this time go into script
- in our example it will be "cd "\Python26\Scripts"
- once inside "Scripts" folder run command 'pip.exe install <name_of_module>'
	example : pip.exe install pyperclip
